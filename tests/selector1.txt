*************************Ways to locate Dynamic Web Elements in Selenium***************

Web Applications comprise of one or more HTML pages. 
All the individual units/fields such as - text box, button, etc., 
that are contained in a web page, are called Web Elements.
On any HTML page, all the elements present on the Data Object Model (DOM)
and are rendered by the browser are called Static elements. 
The elements which are invoked at the run-time and are dynamically
added to the web page are called Dynamic elements.


*********Various elements locators or selectors that used for web elements**********
There are multiple element locators (or selectors) that can be used for 
finding/accessing the web elements such as: 
ID, Name, Class Name, Linked Text, Partial Linked Text, Tag Name, XPath, CSS Selector.

*********************So how do we handle dynamic elements anyway?*************
It is advised that Selenium Test Programmers write their own Customized XPath and CSS Selectors.
Syntax for Customized XPath:
//tagName[@attribute = “value”]

Eg: //input[@type = “email”]


Regular Expressions in Custom XPath Syntax: //tagName[contains(@attribute, ‘value’)]

Eg: //input[contains(@name, ‘userName’)]

Regular Expressions in Custom CSS Syntax: tagName[attribute*= ‘value’]

Eg: input[name *= ‘userName’]


*******************************************Questions****************************************
Q1: If any web element is not exist and you are trying to find that web element.
    So which error you will get ?
Q2: If two or more than two web element is exist with same selectors or locators.
    So in this case you will get any error if No , so which web element will be accessable.
Q3: Select a Checkbox using WebdriverIO?




**************************************Answers************************************************
A3: We will use the click() method then also will verify with isSelected() method that it should be clicked
    if it's not clicked again click.


tagname#id or #id
tagname.classname or .classname
tagname[idname='value']
//tagname[@idname='value']
tagname[id*='user']
//tagname[contains(@id,'user')]
tagname[id^='user']
//tagname[starts-with(@id,'user')]
tagname[id$='name']
//tagname[ends-with(@id,'name')]
